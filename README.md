## My process

### What I learned

In this project, I have practiced the following skills:

- Creating a responsive page with **semantic HTML** and **CSS**
- **Accessibility**: links that open a new tab or window are described using `aria-describedby`
- Using **CSS relative units** to ensure the page scales according to the user's font size settings
- Using **CSS custom properties** to allow easy customization and reusability of components
- Using **Git** and **GitHub**

**Note on accessibility**: Parts of this project contain color contrast ratios that are not WCAG compliant. The colors used are part of Frontend Mentor's original design. In a real-world scenario, changes would be requested to the design team before deploying the project.
